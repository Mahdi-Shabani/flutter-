## Hexagon Button (Sin & Cos Formula)

The floating action button in this UI is a perfect hexagon,  
drawn using the following Dart code with sine and cosine:

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
  final angle = (i * 60) * (pi / 180);
  final x = centerX + radius * cos(angle);
  final y = centerY + radius * sin(angle);
  if (i == 0) {
    path.moveTo(x, y);
  } else {
    path.lineTo(x, y);
  }
}
path.close();
```
